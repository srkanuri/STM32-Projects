1. Description of game concept and core functionality:
   This is a racing game inspired from Brick Racing which we have played during our childhood days.
   A white car is controlled by user either with a nunchuck or a with a gyroscope. The directions dictate
   how the car moves and the z button accelerates the car. The user button can be used to pause the game.
   These are mainly the user controls. The game has 15 levels and each level is present for 80 seconds.
   We have reduced the time for ease in testing. With each level the speed of the Opponent cars increases.
   All the Opponent cars are in Blue color. The score is incremented for every passing opponent car. This
   is double when the user is accelerating with the car. The is a momentary pause with sound to show that
   the level has been passed. The LED are used as a timer device for the game letting the user know how
   much time is left for completing the level. If the user comes in contact with the opponent car, the
   game will end with a crash. We have used a "Game Over" text with crash sound and an image to depcit that.
   Once the game ends, the user is presented with a menu to restart the game or check the instructions,
   look at the highest score and to view author information. There is also a welcome image and music before
   the game starts.

   We did not implement gyroscope, magnetometer since it was not needed for the project.
   We used printf statements to print on screen for debugging purposes.
