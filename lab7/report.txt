Learnings and Challanges:
We learnt about using the accelerometer and magnetometer in this lab.
We calculated the tilt and heading data from the accelerometer and magnetometer readings.
For the final application we implemented a compass on the basis of reading from heading.
The Heading value is also displayed on the LCD. On user button press, we change the lcd data 
to display the tilt data i.e. pitch and roll angle as a bar graph. In addition the tilt data is
also shown as text.

Q1: The accelerometer/magnetometer comes pre-wired on the STM board. Open up the the Data Sheet and find 
    the page with the Pin Descriptions. How many pins does it have? List the pins and their names. 
    Next find the electrical specifications under the Electrical Characteristics section. How many volts (Vdd) 
    are required to power the accelerometer/magnetometer? The accelerometer/magnetometer is sitting somewhere 
    on the STM board. Try to find it and describe where it is.
A:  The device has 14 pins.
    Pin 1:  Vdd_IO
    Pin 2:  SCL
    Pin 3:  SDA
    Pin 4:  INT2
    Pin 5:  INT1
    Pin 6:  C1
    Pin 7:  GND
    Pin 8:  Reserved
    Pin 9:  DRDY
    Pin 10: Reserved
    Pin 11: Reserved
    Pin 12: SETP
    Pin 13: SETC
    Pin 14: Vdd

    The Supply Voltage (Vdd) should be in the range of 2.16 - 3.6
    The accelerometer/magnetometer is preset near the top right corner of STM32 as a rectangular chip like a gyroscope. 

Q2: Why do we write to the accelerometer/magnetometer before we can read from them? What are the following lines of code doing?
A:  The master device has to write to the slave to denote that it is expecting a read operation from slave.
    Once the information is received and acknowledged, the slave can start sending the data to master.

    The code mentioned in the question, holds the configuration settings for the slave.
    They are to be written to slave before the actual operation can happen.

Q3: What do the following lines of code do?
A:  The code mentioend in this question is the calculation logic to obtain the accelerometer values in radians.
    Each byte is added with a 8 bit shifted value to handle the float values.

Q4: Why might it be necessary to tilt compensate your compass computation?
A:  Tilt compensation is needed to get an accurate value of heading with respect to geographic north.
    For changes in Roll and Pitch there might be a slight change in the heading value and it needs to be compensated.
