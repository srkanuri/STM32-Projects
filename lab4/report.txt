1. How many connections are required to communicate over UART?
A: There are 2 main connections needed for communication over UART : Recieve(RX) and Transmit(TX). 
   We also have a ground connection which is already present in STM32

2. What is the purpose of "alternate functions" for GPIO pins?
A: UART's connections can be configured to certain GPIO pins in every port. This configuration can be done by an alternate function. 
   We do not confgure any pin as input or output but rather set them to the Alternate function which will define them for us.

3. Define "baud rate" in your own words.
A: Baud rate is the rate of signals transmitted per second.

4. Why do we need newlib_stubs? Specifically, is there a reason that printf won't work on the board without it?
A: Newlib is a set libraries that are platform independent. It is expected that the programmer provides functions which an OS provides. 
   The printf function wont work without newlib_stub since the hardware we have is not associated with any Operating system. 
   Hence we need newlib_stub which is a platform independent library.

5. Give an example of a situation in which the Salae Logic Analyzer is the best debugging method and include a screen shot of the Logic application.
A: Salae Logic Analyzer is connected to STM32 board and will be useful to debug the signals transmitted to the board after code execution. 
   This will be useful to debug if the gdb shows everything to be correct but the hardware signal doesnt work. 
   In other words, it can be used to debug the hardware problems. It can be used also to identify the problems caused by clock mis-configuration.

Learnings:
We mainly learnt about using UART to perform serial communication
We understood about alternate functions and how different pins can be used for serial communication by activating a different alternate function
We learnt about newlib which is developed and maintained by Redhat and serves as a set of platform independent libraries which can be used in Embedded Systems like STM32.
