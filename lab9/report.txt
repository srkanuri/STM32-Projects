Learnings and Challanges:
We worked on an Image display application along with the files display in the root directory. We did not handle the cases for more files than the screen size
or directories but we consider this as a start. We understood how to initialize the SD card and also how the access the files from it in. We started with 
displaying images by reducing the precision from 24 bit to 16 bit BMP image. Once this was complete, we added logic to change the orientation of image with  
accelerometer's pitch and roll values. We tried to make it work first with drawPixel function. But since this is very slow, we changed the logic with pushColor.
We have the complete picture in the Portrait mode and rescaled one for landscape. For every 5 lines of pixels, we removed 1 line of pixels so that the resultant 
image fits the screen size in landscape. Converting the logic from drawPixel to pushColor was difficult to make it work in all the 4 orientations.

Q1: What are we doing here and how does it relate to what we know about SPI?
A:  We are adding a new chip select connection (PB8) for a new SPI communication device i.e the SD card. We also added the pin in f3d_lcd_sd.c driver to 
    initialize the pin. The Chip Select pin is set to high when the device is not communicating and vice versa. SD_CS_HIGH() and SD_CS_LOW() are used for 
    this purpose.

Q2: Explain how you might use the *f3d_delay_uS()* function within the *delay()* function to replace the delay loop below. 
    What would you expect to be the advantage of using a timer over a delay loop?
A:  void delay(int count) {
    	 while (count-- > 0) {
    	       f3d_delay_uS(1000);
    	       }
  	 }
    }

    The advantage with using a timer over a delay loop is that the delay will be constant irrespective of the machine it is executed in.
    The delay loop would differ based on the performance of processor.

Q3: Why might DMA be important in improving the performance of your image display application?
A:  Direct memory access would improve the performance of image display as the processor doesn't have to orchestrate the complete transfer and work on
    other jobs which do not need memory. This way the processor gets to compute data in parallel to accessing image data from memory.

Q4: Research the FAT file system and describe the function of the file allocation table. 
    Explain how the corruption of an entry in the table can cause part of a file to be lost.
A:  The functions of the file allocation table is to store the cluster associations of a file in order. If a file cluster is accessed and the next cluster
    is needed, we can refer to the file allocation table. Generally 2 copies of file allocation table are saved in the file system to check if there is any
    corruption in it. This is one of the essential functions of file allocation table to maintain consistency.

    The table contains the list of all file clusters in order. If a file reading is in process and we find out that the file allocation table is 
    corrupt from that point, the rest of the file cannot be retrieved and this part of file is lost.

Q5: What is the difference between FAT16 and FAT32?
A:  16 and 32 are the number of bits needed for an entry in file allocation table. Hence more files can be stored in FAT32 when compared to FAT16. 
    The maximum memory storable in FAT16 is 4 GB. The file names can longer in FAT32 when compared to FAT16 file system.
