  **************          LAB3 REPORT         *****************
 ***************************************************************

1. What are specs of the board you are using (ex. Speed, RAM, Flash)?
A: STM32 F100 processor with a speed of 24Mhz and having a RAM of 8 KB and a Flash Memory of 128 KB.

2. What does GPIO stand for?
A: General Purpose Input Output.

3. Is the provided delay function accurate? Why or why not? EDIT This question will be disregarded as this delay function does not have parameter Sorry for the confusion
A: The delay function provided is accurate as the human eye can observe the change using the delay function.

4. What are the Port and Pin Numbers of the two Green LEDs?
A: Port E : Pins 11 and 15 (PE11 and PE15)

5. What are the public attributes of the GPIO_InitTypeDef Struct?
A: GPIO_Pin, GPIO_Mode, GPIO_Speed, GPIO_OType, GPIO_PuPd

Difficulties:
There were no major roadblocks in doing this Lab, but we wanted to try out new things and tried various other ways of invoking LED output and taking User Input.
It was a pleasure to program the LEDs to blink and bringing in the user input.

Learnings:
We understood how to make and download the code to STM32
We learnt about GPIO_InitTypeDef which is the structure used to initialize any pin.
We learnt about the importance of enabling clock for the GPIO prior to configuration.
